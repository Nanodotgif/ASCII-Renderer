# ASCII-Renderer
The goal of this project is to be a semi-user friendly ascii/console "game engine" of sorts and to provide a way to create visually appealing and accessible console applications with Python.
The original idea was to print frames to the console as strings of characters slideshow style, but this proved to be inconsistent between computers and environments and to unstable to function properly.
BUT, I've just discovered windows curses, so I'm rewriting the whole thing with curses to hopefuly provide a smoother and more consistent experience.
